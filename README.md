- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyberAlita
- 👀 I love God!!! I'm also into everything--Divergent, KPop, the Outsiders, sports, and Wii
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JS, and Python, as well as CybPat/Cybersecurity--Cisco and Windows/S19!
- 💞️ I’m looking for internship opportunities!!
- 📫 How to reach me. . . I'm still trying to figure out this server. 
- If the user's email is public, it's listed on their profile and you can contact them. Otherwise, on a specific repo, you can create a new (public) issue, which will send a message to the author of that repo. (If it's a private security issue, perhaps you can say "I have a private security issue, how should I contact you?")
